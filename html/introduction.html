        <h2>Why Use CSS?</h2>
        <p>CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.</p>
        <h2>CSS Solved a Big Problem</h2>
        <p>HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!</p>
        <p>HTML was created to <strong>describe the content</strong> of a web page like:</p>
        <p>&lt;h1>This is a heading&lt;/h1></p>
        <p>&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
        <p>When tags like &lt;font&gt;, and color attributes were addesd to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.</p>
        <p>To solce this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.</p>
        <p>CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!</p>

        <h2>CSS Saves a Lot of Work!</h2>
        <p>The style definitions are normally saved in external .css files.</p>
        <p>With an external stylesheet file, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!</p>
